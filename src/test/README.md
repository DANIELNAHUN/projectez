- `generateNestedTasks()` - Creates complex nested structures

### Test Helpers
- `mockLocalStorage()` - localStorage simulation
- `createMockStore()` - Vuex store mocking
- `createMockRouter()` - Vue Router mocking
- `mountComponent()` - Vue component mounting helper

### Validation Helpers
- Data integrity checkers
- Performance measurement utilities
- Error simulation functions
- Async operation testing support

## Test Configuration

### Vitest Configuration
- Environment: happy-dom for DOM simulation
- Global test utilities available
- Automatic mock clearing between tests
- TypeScript support for test files

### Mock Setup
- localStorage mocking for all tests

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Group related tests in describe blocks
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Keep tests focused and independent

### Data Management
- Use mock factories for consistent test data
- Clean up between tests automatically
- Avoid hardcoded values where possible
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Performance Considerations
